# Simple and Fast Short URL Project

This project is a simple implementation of a URL-shortening service using PHP, HTML, and Bootstrap. It allows users to shorten long URLs into shorter, more manageable links.
Sorry, the front design is not good. I focused more on the back-end part
## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have the following software installed on your system:

- PHP (version 7 or above)
- Web server (e.g., Apache)
- MySQL database

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.
2. Create a new MySQL database for the project.
3. Open the `config.php` file and update the database connection details (host, username, password, database name) accordingly.
4. Ensure that the project files are placed in a directory accessible by your web server.

## Usage

1. Access the project through your web server using the configured URL.
2. On the main page, you will find a form where you can enter a long URL that you want to shorten.
3. Submit the form, and you will receive a shortened URL.
4. You can now use the shortened URL to access the original long URL.

## Features

- Shortens long URLs into compact links.
- Uses a MySQL database to store URL mappings.
- Redirects users to the original URL when they access the shortened URL.
